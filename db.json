      "description": "THE U.S. CORONAVIRUS death toll climbed to 50 on Saturday as President Donald Trump confirmed he was broadening America's virus-related travel restrictions with Europe and that he himself had been tested for COVID-19. During a wide-ranging news conference on Saturday afternoon, Trump confirmed he was adding the U.K. and Ireland to a list of travel-restricted countries that spans China, Iran and much of Europe. White House officials have suggested the travel restrictions will minimize coronavirus spread in the U.S. 'If you don't have to travel, I wouldn't do it,' Trump said, also acknowledging that conversations are ongoing about possibly restricting domestic travel within the U.S.",
